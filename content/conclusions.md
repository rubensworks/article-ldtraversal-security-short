## Conclusions
{:#conclusions}

With this prospective analysis, we have illustrated the importance of more security-oriented research
in the domain on LTQP and the general handling of decentralized environments such as [Solid](cite:cites solid),
especially in presence of data behind authentication.
In future work, work is needed to determine mitigation strategies for them,
which may be inspired by existing techniques in related domains.
Furthermore, research will be needed to test the impact of these mitigations on implementation,
analyze their performance impact,
introduce more performant techniques and algorithms,
and introduce and apply attack models to test their effectiveness.
Since our analysis of security vulnerabilities is by no means exhaustive,
additional research efforts are needed to uncover and predict potential security vulnerabilities in LTQP.
Such future research---with our work as a first step---is crucial for enabling a decentralized Web which we can query securely.
