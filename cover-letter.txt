To the Editors of the Semantic Web Journal

Dear Editors,

Please find attached to this letter our submission entitled
"A Prospective Analysis of Security Vulnerabilities within Link Traversal-Based Query Processing"
for the call for full papers, as suggested by the editors-in-chief.
In this article, we focus on the security aspect of Link Traversal-Based Query Processing,
which has received minimal research attention so far.

In particular, the main contribution of this work is
an analysis of 10 potential security threats within the domain of Link Traversal-Based Query Processing.
In order to assess the validity of this work,
we classify these threats using an existing classification method for security vulnerabilities in software.

We hope this article is a good fit for this journal.
Should you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
We look forward to hearing back from you and thank you in advance
for considering the publication of this work in the Semantic Web Journal.

Sincerely,
Ruben Taelman
on behalf of the authors
